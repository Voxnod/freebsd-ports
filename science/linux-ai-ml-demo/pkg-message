  message: <<EOM
To build this port, it is necessary to first prepare a distfile containing the
required Linux Python packages, as their installation process is non-trivial.
The 'create-distfile' target must be executed to accomplish this:

	make create-distfile

This process may take significant time. Upon completion, the resulting distfile
will contain all necessary Linux Python packages.

To utilize CUDA support for PyTorch, both Shkhln's compatibility library
preloading and Linux compatibility layer usage are required, as demonstrated in
the provided demonstration scripts.

To run Stable Diffusion demonstration script simply launch it:

	run-stable-diffusion-demo

The port also provides Pytorch examples from the official GitHub repository.
To run and modify these examples, copy them to a user-writable directory
(e.g., ~/pytorch-examples) and then launch wrapper script:

	cp -r /usr/local/share/ai-ml-demo/pytorch-examples ~/pytorch-examples
	run-pytorch-examples-demo ~/pytorch-examples/run_python_examples.sh
